# Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

Supervised Learning algorithms produce a function that predicts the outcome of a process given some inputs.
In these tutorials, you will learn how to fit a machine learning model to predict 

## Next Steps

The [Scikit-Learn Documentation on supervised learning](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) 
discusses the theory behind many more types of models than what we illustrate here and explain how to use them.
You will want to be able to use a broad library of models and understand how to tune them to be successful in
applying machine learning to your own problems.
